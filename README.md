I merged this into my existing [lab-assay-lims project](https://github.com/jackaI1/lab-assay-lims/tree/main/projects/titration-curve-analysis). The current code is in `projects/titration-curve-analysis/` there. I kept the code here so older links still work.

The move keeps the original layout, including `mineral_assay/__init__.py`, `mineral_assay/cli.py`, `mineral_assay/titration.py`, `mineral_assay/xrf.py`. I replaced the README with the report below and left out Git history, installed dependencies, caches and generated build output from the hub copy.

The project checks are configured in the hub at `.github/workflows/titration-curve-analysis-test.yml`, with commands run from this project folder and changes filtered to its paths.

# titration-curve-analysis

I built a tool for analyzing laboratory measurements to learn how the underlying idea works. This is a learning project.

## Working with measurements

A titration adds a reagent of known concentration until the reaction reaches its equivalence point. Save the added volume in mL as `volume_ml` and readings as `ph` or `potential_mv` in a CSV file, with volumes strictly increasing. The endpoint can be estimated from the strongest change in the curve (first derivative), a nearby change in curvature (second derivative), or a Gran plot, which extrapolates a selected straight-line region before the endpoint. A search range helps isolate the desired endpoint when there are several changes.

```python
from mineral_assay.titration import Curve, equivalence, gran, concentration, replicate_summary

curve = Curve.csv('examples/acid_replicate_1.csv')
endpoint = equivalence(curve, method='second', search=(8, 12))
gran_endpoint = gran(curve, sample_volume_ml=20, fit_range=(4, 8), model='strong_acid')
result = concentration(endpoint, titrant_mol_l=0.1, sample_ml=20)
print(endpoint, gran_endpoint, result)  # mL, mL, mol/L
print(replicate_summary([0.049, 0.050, 0.051]))
```

For a back titration, pass `initial_reagent_mol`: the titrant measures the reagent left over, which is subtracted from the known amount initially added. `analyte_per_titrant` specifies the mole ratio. The back titrant and excess reagent are assumed to react one-to-one. Replicate uncertainty is the sample standard deviation and standard error of independently calculated concentrations; it does not include calibration, volume or model uncertainty.

## Other assay calculations

XRF measures energy peaks associated with elements. `mineral_assay.xrf.fit_spectrum` fits known Fe, Cu, Zn and Ca line positions with Gaussian peaks and a background, returning integrated peak areas. `calibrate` fits a line through measured standard areas and known concentrations. Standards should match the sample matrix; overlapping lines, detector response and matrix effects can make the estimate misleading.

Flotation separates a feed into concentrate and tailings. `mineral_assay.flotation.reconcile` adjusts measured grades and mass pull (the fraction of feed reporting to concentrate) within stated measurement uncertainties to satisfy a metal balance. It returns recovery, the fraction of feed metal in the concentrate. `grade_prediction_flags` checks for fractions outside 0 to 1 and concentrate metal exceeding feed metal.

## Design and limits

The derivative methods interpolate uneven additions onto a uniform grid, smooth with a Savitzky-Golay filter and find a peak or nearby zero crossing. Choose the smoothing window and search range based on the curve. Gran fits require pH and a user-selected linear region: the implemented strong-acid and weak-acid formulas assume acid titrated with strong base. They are not general-purpose formulas for bases, polyprotic systems or activity corrections. Synthetic acid curves include an exact charge balance and noise; the weak-acid test uses a buffer approximation. These methods should be checked against standards and real laboratory measurements before use for decisions.

## Tests and limits

There are 1 test source files in this copy. That source count does not establish an execution result. This is a source snapshot, and running it on a new machine may need environment-specific setup.
